# Personal Website
The purpose of my website, aside from being my public face on the internet, is to serve as a programming sandbox of sorts, allowing me to test new technologies and ideas in my own environment. It also provides me with my own central hub, in the form of an "admin" section, where I can build tools and other functionalities for convenience, learning, and fun. I've chosen to make the repository public in hopes of showcasing the way I work and providing some samples of my code. 

Both the public and admin sections of the site are fully responsive. The public facing portions are compatible with the most recent versions of each browser, however the admin section is designed with only Chrome support in mind.

## Technologies
The website is currently built using a combination of React, Redux, and PostCSS with a server-layer written using Node and Express. 

## Admin Samples
Since the admin section contains the bulk of the content currently, but is only accessible to myself I've added a few screenshots below to illustrate some of the screens.
