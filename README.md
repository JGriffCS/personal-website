# Personal Website
The purpose of my website, aside from being my public face on the internet, is to serve as a programming sandbox of sorts, allowing me to test new technologies and ideas in my own environment. It also provides me with my own central hub, in the form of an "admin" section, where I can build tools and other functionalities for convenience, learning, and fun. I've chosen to make the repository public in hopes of showcasing the way I work and providing some samples of my code. 

## Technologies
The website is currently built using a combination of React, Redux, and PostCSS with a server-layer written using Node and Express.
